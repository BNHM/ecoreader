        <h1>Welcome to the EcoReader</h1>
        <p>A vast store of knowledge on our natural environment is not contained in databases or in digital format. It exists in hand-written and typed field notebooks containing critical ecological and biological details in observations, drawings, and photographs. While there are applications to aid in the digitization of these notebooks or aggregate metadata (e.g. Archivist Toolkit, ArchiveSpace, Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL)) there is no open source application to directly publish, visualize, and query digitized notebooks from source collections that enable direct control over the input and output process via code.</p>
        
        <p>ecoReader was conceived by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology to quickly and easily make field notebooks accessible for online viewing originally in 2003. This <a href=https://github.com/BNHM/ecoreader>ecoReader code library</a> re-imagines the online reader,  designed to easily support multiple data input formats, and uses a common notebook metadata interface, which allows for consistent output using a centralized indexing mechanism.</p>
        
      	<p>This portal provides access to digitized field notes from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology Archives. Field notes that have not been scanned are also listed for reference. We will continue to add more volumes as they are cataloged. Please contact the Archives at mvzarchives@berkeley.edu.com for more information.</p>
